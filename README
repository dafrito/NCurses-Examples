This is a collection of tiny programs I've done in NCurses. None of them are
especially useful, but they're interesting. Many are implementations of ideas
and examples gained from Dan Gookin's excellent book, "Programmer's Guide to
nCurses".

Peruse them by just checking out individual tags, like so:

$ git tag -l
... choose a tag ...
$ git checkout $YOUR_TAG
$ make
$ ./a.out

This is perhaps an abusive use of git, but it's worked very well for me personally.
